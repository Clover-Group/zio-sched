/**
 * Source for InfluxDB
 * @param sourceId simple mark to pass to sink
 * @param dbName wich DB to use
 * @param url to database, for example `http://localhost:8086`
 * @param query Influx SQL query for data
 * @param eventsMaxGapMs maximum gap by which source data will be split, i.e. result incidents will be split by these gaps
 * @param defaultEventsGapMs "typical" gap between events, used to unite nearby incidents in one (sessionization)
 * @param partitionFields fields by which data will be split and paralleled physically
 * @param datetimeField name of datetime field, could be timestamp and regular time (will be parsed by JodaTime)
 * @param userName for auth
 * @param password for auth
 * @param timeoutSec for DB connection
 * @param parallelism of source task (not recommended to chagne)
 * @param numParallelSources number of absolutely separate sources to create. Patterns also will be separated by
 *                           equal (as much as possible) buckets by the max window in pattern (TBD by sum window size)
 * @param patternsParallelism number of parallel branch nodes splitted after sink stage (node). Patterns also
 *                            separated by approx. equal buckets by the max window in pattern (TBD by sum window size)
